# Car Makers Data Analysis

## Overview
This project uses Python and well-known data science libraries to examine a dataset of automakers, investigating different factors like price, horsepower, fuel type, body style, and engine specifications.

## Data Source
-The CarMakers.csv file, which houses the dataset utilized for this investigation, includes a number of car properties, such as:
 Car ID

## Manufacturer (Make)
Fuel Type
Aspiration
Number of Doors
Body Style
Drive Wheels
Engine Location
Performance Metrics (Horsepower, MPG, Engine Size, etc.)
Price

## Libraries Used
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
statistics for statistical analysis
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
plotly for interactive plots
datetime for time-based operations
collections.Counter for frequency analysis

## Analysis Performed
This project covers the following key insights:
Average price by car make
Horsepower distribution across body styles
Fuel type distribution
Most common drive-wheel type by manufacturer
Correlation between engine size and price
Average city MPG variation by number of cylinders
Top 10 most expensive cars
Car make with the highest average horsepower
Price trends by fuel type and aspiration
Comparison between highway MPG and city MPG
Relationship between weight and engine size
Distribution of car lengths
Effect of number of doors on average price
Most common engine location
Compression ratio comparison by make
Price vs Horsepower for all models
Top car makes by volume
Average stroke length by cylinder count
Body-style with the highest number of entries
Price comparison by drive-wheel configuration
Peak RPM trend across makes

## Visualizations
This analysis includes various charts and graphs to help visualize the trends and relationships between variables, such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and interactive dashboards.
